# Set Classification Methods for Histopathology Data

For the final project for STAT441 (Statistical Learning - Classification), we reproduced 2 previously proposed approaches: Expectation-Maximization and Deep Sets algorithms to recognize 3 types of lung cancer, and compared their resulting accuracies.

The dataset was obtained on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aicoder/histopathology-dataset). Note that the provided histopathology data is small and heavily unbalanced.

While training a neural network on this data was a very challenging task, we showed that it was possible to obtain a reasonable accuracy with both methods: 60% with EM-based approach and 70% with the Deep Sets algorithm. Template code is provided in the notebook `EM_algorithm_new.ipynb` notebook file.

See `Classification_final_project_report.pdf` for the project writeup.
